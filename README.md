# ArchaIdr

Classic Arcade games written in Idris compiled to JavaScript.

## Summary

TL;DR: Come and join me learning Idris and Game programming!

## Implemented games

 * Pong [game](https://andorp.github.io/ArchaIdr/pong/pong.html) [source](https://github.com/andorp/ArchaIdr/Pong)
 * More to come, when I have free time...

## Game programming is fun and complex

My goal here is to to have fun and learn something new. I would like provide examples of complex
Idris programs which try to find the balance between pragmatic programming and applied dependent
types. I believe that dependent typed are useful in software development and they are not that
hard. In many cases I find restricting myself in other programming paradigms, in a good sense,
as an engineer one sees the problems and their theoretical solutions, but the theoretical
solutions needs to be converted into the tools we are at hand, as we are actually interested
solving some real world problems. I think dependent types add to the programmers toolbox and
makes the theoretical to practical transition easier in complex systems.

Games are fun. I started my programming carrier implementing games of my own. But also games are
complex. Games represent many problems in modern software architectures. Implementing complex games
are hard and makes the programmers mind bend, which is good for learning. I am not a game programmer.
I became a software engineer, and forgot about games for a long time. So it is time for me to
relearn some of these things.

I hope this experience teaches me on how to use dependent types in a pragmatic way. I hope I will
find patterns and I can provide feedback for the Idris community which I appreciate for their work
and for their effort bringing practical dependent types to the (FP) world.

## Note

There is no applied dependent types in this repository so far. Although soon to come, as I try
to apply the things from the depedently typed programming [book](https://www.manning.com/books/type-driven-development-with-idris).
